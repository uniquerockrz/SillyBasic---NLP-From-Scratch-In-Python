## What Is Machine Learning

At the very basic level, machine learning is statistics and mathematics. One of the most basic algorithm in machine learning is as shown below - linear regression.

As we see here, we have plotted some points along X-Y axis. We have fitted a line along these points. Now, say, we want to predict a new value, how do we do that? We do so by finding a point along X axis, getting that point in line, and then finding the corresponding Y value.

This is an example of prediction. What do we do in classification, another common task done by machine learning? Let's look at K nearest neighbors, another common and easy to understand algorithm in machine learning.

We see we have from some clusters/groups based on nearest points the points have. How do we find the group/classification of a new point? By simply taking the nearest points and finding the group they belong to.
